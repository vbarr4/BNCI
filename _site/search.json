    "text": "Note\nThis is my first attempt at a Quarto website – it’s definitely a work in progress!\n\n\nBrief Bio\nI am the Margaret Hamilton Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Computer Science program at Bard College. I was previously the Jean Sammet Professor in the Computer Science department at Mount Holyoke College. Before that I was in the Computer Science Department at Union College. I spent 2013-2014 on temporary assignment to the National Science Foundation, serving as a program director in the Division of Undergraduate Education.\nI also previously served on the faculty at Hofstra University. During my graduate studies I taught at Pratt Institute, Rutgers University, Mount Holyoke College, and Polytechnic University (now NYU Tandon School of Engineering). I received my Masters degree from New York University and my Ph.D. from Rutgers University.\n\n\nResearch Overview\nMy research interests are primarily in\n\ncomputer science education, particularly new curricula that will engage an increasingly diverse group of students in CS\nworking collaboratively with colleagues in other disciplines to apply computing to problems in their fields\nreanalyzing degree attainment data to better identify and understand longstanding trends in the areas of gender & race and ethnicity\nsoftware testing, particularly applied to various kinds of artificial intelligence and language processing systems,\n\nThere is much more information on the Grants page and the Research page.\n\n\nTeaching\nIn Fall, 2023, I am teaching Programming Languages and the brand new Introduction to Data Analytics and R Programming\n\n\nOther Activities\nWithin Bard:\n\nDirector for the Data Analytics concentration\nMember of the steering committee for Experimental Humanities\n\nOutside of Bard:\n\nCo-PI and Steering Ctte. member for the Alliance for Identity Inclusive Computing Education\nMember of LACS, the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium"
